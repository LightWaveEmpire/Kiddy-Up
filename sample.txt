My name is Emma Lane and I am the Recruitment Chair for Phi Sigma Rho. Phi Sigma Rho is a social sorority for women in engineering and technical studies of all levels, including Computer Science. Our recruitment this year will occur from today, September 8th, to September 16th. We would greatly appreciate it if you could share this flyer and document with your advisors and female students. Please let me know if you have any questions or have trouble accessing the attached files.
